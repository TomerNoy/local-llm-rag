I need to be very precise with you here, because this is where many
strong engineers lose both jobs and startups.\
Your instinct is valid. Your current approach is **dangerous**.\
If you mix:

- "lead engineer on CV"

- "no ownership in interviews"

- "secret expectation of future 50% ownership"\
  you are walking into a legal and trust minefield.\
  But there *is* a clean structure that protects you **and** does not
  harm your job search.\
  \
  **The mistake to avoid**\
  Do **not** attempt to combine:

<!-- -->

- employee framing externally

- founder expectations internally\
  without formal structure.\
  This creates:

<!-- -->

- ownership disputes

- broken trust

- legal exposure

- recruiter risk if discovered later\
  \
  **The only safe structure**\
  You need **two independent agreements**:\
  \
  **1️⃣ Contractor Agreement (now)**\
  This is the document that supports your CV.\
  It must state:

<!-- -->

- You are an **independent contractor**.

- Your role: **Lead Mobile Engineer**.

- Start date, scope, confidentiality.

- No equity, no management role.

- Either side can terminate.\
  This is what you show the world.\
  \
  **2️⃣ Equity Trigger Agreement (separate, private)**\
  This is your protection.\
  This is **not** part of your employment framing. This is a private
  legal agreement between you and your colleague.\
  It can be called:

<!-- -->

- "Option Agreement"

- "Equity Vesting Trigger Agreement"

- "Conditional Share Transfer Agreement"\
  It states:\
  If the product reaches defined milestones (revenue, funding round,
  acquisition, etc.), you receive **X% ownership**.\
  Until then: you own **0%**.\
  This keeps your story clean and your future protected.\
  \
  **Example of how this works**\
  Externally:

<!-- -->

- You are a contractor.

- No founder language.

- No equity mentioned.

- No conflict signals.\
  Internally:

<!-- -->

- You have a signed agreement that if the company succeeds, you gain
  ownership.\
  You are protected. Your job search is protected. Your future upside is
  protected.\
  \
  **Critical point**\
  Never rely on:

<!-- -->

- verbal promises

- "we'll figure it out later"

- friendship\
  If the product succeeds, money will destroy ambiguity.\
  \
  **Bottom line**\
  You can be:

<!-- -->

- a professional contractor today

- and a future owner tomorrow\
  **Only if the agreements are separate.**\
  That is the only structure that does not sabotage your career or your
  equity.
